## ‚õîWARNING
*The script is in early development stage which I'm currently working with on my local machine, this repository is nothing more than a fork now!*

## üéê Introduction
Starting as a fork of *BOT EXPERIMENT Credit:FURIOUSPUPPY*, I was planning to apply only some little fixes to improve my personal experience when playing with bots. After facing a lot of issues, I got lost, but at the same time a whole new bunch of ideas came to my mind. So I decided to do a major revamp that can helps the bots become more interesting to play with, which I call **The Computer Bots**
